      <h2>Starting My Ecommerce Journey</h2>
      <div class="post-content">
        
      <p>Hello world! My name is Michåel Scøtt (yes, with the cool Scandinavian letters), and I'm about to embark on the greatest journey of my entrepreneurial career.</p>

      <p>For years, I've dreamed of running my own ecommerce empire. I've read all the books - "The 4-Hour Workweek", "Rich Dad Poor Dad", even "The Art of War" (because business is war, right?). Now it's time to put theory into practice.</p>

      <p>My business idea? I'm going to sell artisanal snow globes. But not just any snow globes - these will be LIMITED EDITION PREMIUM snow globes featuring famous business leaders. Think Warren Buffett in a snow globe. Bill Gates in a snow globe. Oprah in a snow globe. Genius, right?</p>

      <p>The only challenge? Shipping. That's where I discovered <strong>Easyship</strong>. They have this amazing API that lets me integrate shipping directly into my website. I'm basically a tech entrepreneur now.</p>

      <p>And speaking of being a tech entrepreneur - I just set up this <strong>GitHub repository</strong> for blogging my entire project! Pretty impressive organizational skills, huh? You can check out the <strong>source code</strong> and see how a real developer does it: <a href="https://github.com/easyship-autobot/scott-globes" style="color: #667eea; font-weight: bold;">github.com/easyship-autobot/scott-globes</a></p>

      <p>Stay tuned as I document my journey from corporate drone to self-made millionaire!</p>
