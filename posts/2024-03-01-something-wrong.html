      <p>Okay, so something strange is going on with my Easyship account.</p>

      <p>I've been getting email notifications about shipments being created, but I didn't create them. At first, I thought it was just delayed notifications from my test shipment. But there have been like 15 shipments in the past week.</p>

      <p>I checked my Easyship dashboard and there are dozens of shipments to addresses I don't recognize. Mumbai, São Paulo, Tokyo, Moscow. I don't even have customers yet! My website isn't even live!</p>

      <p>My credit card bill is... not good. $3,847 in shipping charges. For shipments I didn't create.</p>

      <p>Maybe it's a glitch? I've emailed Easyship support. They said they're investigating "suspicious activity" on my account. What does that even mean?</p>

      <p>I'm starting to get worried. This was supposed to be my big break, not my big mistake.</p>
