      <h2>I GOT HACKED üò±</h2>
      <div class="post-content">
        
      <p>UNBELIEVABLE. Someone hacked my Easyship account and has been using my API key to create fraudulent shipments.</p>

      <p>Easyship support confirmed it. Someone got access to my API key and has been creating shipments for weeks. The final bill? <strong>$12,473.89</strong></p>

      <p>But HOW?! I never shared my API key with anyone. I kept it completely secure. This is clearly a security breach on Easyship's end. Their platform must have been compromised. There's no other explanation.</p>

      <p>I've been extremely careful with my development practices. And yes, I made sure to delete that .env file as soon as I realized it was there. I'm not some amateur who leaves sensitive files lying around.</p>

      <p>The real issue here is that Easyship's security clearly isn't up to par. I mean, how else could someone possibly get my API key? It's not like I wrote it down on a sticky note or emailed it to anyone. I follow best practices. I use Git. I know what I'm doing.</p>

      <p>I'm working with my credit card company to dispute these charges. I also called Easyship support, and they told me to "generate a new API key and revoke the old one." Excuse me? My key works perfectly with my app! How would a NEW key work with my existing lock? That makes no sense. I told them, "Don't tell me to change my key. YOU should fix the lock!" They tried to explain something about "the key being compromised" but honestly, their support team doesn't seem to understand basic security concepts. If the lock is broken, fix the lock!</p>

      <p>In the meantime, I've had to pause my business dreams. The snow globe empire will have to wait. But mark my words - I'll be back stronger than ever.</p>
